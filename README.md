# The Invisible Workforce: Who’s at Risk of Being Left Behind by AI?
* People at highest risk from AI may be the least prepared to adapt... who are they? What can be done? *

> “The people most at risk of being replaced by AI are often the least resourced to adapt. What if we could identify them — and help?”

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores which occupations and communities are most vulnerable to AI-driven displacement using public datasets from O*NET, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Census. The goal is to uncover patterns of risk, highlight skill retraining pathways, and propose data-driven interventions that could improve the lives of millions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Score U.S. jobs by AI susceptibility
- Identify at-risk populations using geographic and demographic overlays
- Explore skill transferability and upskilling opportunities
- Publish findings to spark conversation and collaboration

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- Python, pandas, SQL (via dbt)
- Causal inference & clustering
- Geospatial visualization
- Streamlit for interactive exploration
- GitHub for transparency & reproducibility
- Vector embedding for U.S. jobs to understand semantic distance between different classes of AI susceptible jobs

## 📁 Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Analysis and modeling
- `streamlit_app/`: Optional frontend for interactivity
- `reports/`: Whitepaper, data visuals, final artifacts

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Millions face the threat of job loss due to automation, yet very few have a path forward. If we can spotlight risk with clarity and compassion — and show what's possible with data — we can spark policy, products, and partnerships that actually help.

## 🚀 Outputs (In Progress)

- [ ] Vulnerability Index by Occupation
- [ ] Map of AI Disruption Hotspots
- [ ] Retraining Opportunity Graph
- [ ] Public Report + Streamlit Dashboard
- [ ] Video Explainer: “What if we prepared instead of panicked?”

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

This repo is a work in progress. If you're an engineer, designer, educator, policymaker, or just curious human — let’s jam. DM me or open an issue.
